## 📝 About the project

Humanity at the time I'm writing this peace of information is, unfortunately, living through the SARS‑CoV‑2 (Coronavirus) pandemic. My goal with this project is to help with and spread **correct and reliable** information to the people, mostly living in Brazil, although this project can also be helpful to others outside of it's living country.

## 📚 How this project was created

Since the beginning of the pandemic in March of 2020 I've started learning Data Science with a real world dataset. Since then, I was creating numerous charts and spreadsheets, and, of course, I was having a lot of insights.

At the beginning I was getting data from the Minister of Health of Brazil and for reliability of the data, basically a lot of researchers changed the data source, including me. I don't remember exactly when I've changed the source but the actual **source is provided** by [Brasil.io](https://brasil.io/covid19/).

After a long period only working with Python, static chart images and spreadsheets I've decided to create an online dashboard, from where I was able to share my work more dynamically.
